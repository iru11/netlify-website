      <h4>Uber Got Hacked</h4>
      
      <label for="handle3" style="text-align: center;">A hacker gained access to vulnerability reports and shared images of the company's internal systems, email dashboard, and Slack server during a cyberattack that occurred on Thursday afternoon. Uber was the victim of the assault. <br><br><br><em style="color: grey;">Read more.</em></label>
    </h2>
    <div class="content">
    <p>The images that the hacker distributed and that BleepingComputer was able to see indicate what looks to be complete access to numerous essential IT systems used by Uber, including as the company's security software and the Windows domain.
      The hacker also gained access to other systems owned by the corporation, such as the Amazon Web Services panel, the VMware ESXi virtual machines, the Google Workspace email admin dashboard, and the Slack server, to which the hacker wrote messages.
      Since then, Uber has acknowledged the assault by tweeting that they are communicating with law authorities and that they would provide further details as they become available.
      "An issue involving cybersecurity has been identified, and we are working to resolve it. We are in communication with the appropriate authorities, and we will provide more details on this page as they become available "tweet sent from the account for Uber Communications.
      The New York Times, which was the first publication to report on the breach, claimed to have spoken to the threat actor, who said that they gained access to Uber's network by conducting a social engineering assault on one employee and obtaining their password.
      Using the credentials that had been taken, the threat actor was subsequently able to get access to the company's internal systems.
      In recent years, social engineering has emerged as a prevalent strategy used in assaults directed at well-known businesses such as Twitter, MailChimp, Robinhood, and Okta.
      During this assault on Uber, the threat actor may have stolen data and source code from the company; but, they also had access to what may be an even more valuable asset.
      Sam Curry, a security engineer with Yuga Labs, claims that the hacker also had access to the company's HackerOne bug bounty program, via which they made comments on all of the company's bug reward requests.
      Curry informed BleepingComputer that he first became aware of the issue when the attacker posted the aforementioned remark on a vulnerability report that he had sent to Uber around two years before.
      The HackerOne bug bounty program that Uber offers enables independent security researchers to confidentially report flaws in the company's software and mobile applications in return for a monetary reward from the company's bug bounty program. These reports of vulnerabilities are supposed to be kept private until a remedy can be made available in order to stop attackers from using them in attacks while the problem is being fixed.
      Curry went on to reveal that an Uber worker had reported that the threat actor had access to all of the company's confidential vulnerability submissions that were made on HackerOne.
      A source informed BleepingComputer that the attacker downloaded all vulnerability reports before they lost access to Uber's bug reward program. This information was provided to BleepingComputer. This very certainly includes complaints of vulnerabilities that have not been resolved, which poses a significant threat to Uber's data security.
      Since then, the Uber bug reward program has been deactivated on HackerOne, thereby blocking access to the vulnerabilities that were discovered.
      Nevertheless, it would not be unusual if the threat actor had already acquired the vulnerability reports, and it is probable that they would sell them to other threat actors in order to immediately cash out on the assault.
      BleepingComputer has contacted out to Uber with more questions about the assault; but, at this time, we have not received a response from Uber.</p>
